# Collections System - How It Works

## ✅ There's No Bug - This is How Collections Work!

When you **create a new collection**, it starts empty with **0 problems**. This is the correct and expected behavior!

## 📚 How to Use Collections

### Step 1: Create a Collection
1. Go to **Collections** page
2. Click **"+ New Collection"** button
3. Enter collection name (e.g., "Dynamic Programming", "Arrays", "Interview Prep")
4. Add optional description
5. Click **Create**
6. ✅ Collection is created with **0 problems** (this is normal!)

### Step 2: Add Problems to Collection
1. Go to **Dashboard**
2. Click on **any problem** to view its details
3. At the top of the problem detail page, you'll see a dropdown: **"Add to Collection"**
4. Select your collection from the dropdown
5. ✅ Problem is added to the collection!

### Step 3: View Collection
1. Go back to **Collections** page
2. Click on your collection
3. ✅ Now you'll see all the problems you added!

## 🎯 Example Workflow

```
Create "Arrays" Collection → Shows 0 problems ✅

Go to Dashboard → Click "Two Sum" problem
  ↓
Add "Two Sum" to "Arrays" collection
  ↓
View "Arrays" Collection → Shows 1 problem ✅

Go to Dashboard → Click "Best Time to Buy Stock"
  ↓
Add to "Arrays" collection
  ↓
View "Arrays" Collection → Shows 2 problems ✅
```
