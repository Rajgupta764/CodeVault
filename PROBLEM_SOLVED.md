# ✅ FIXED! - Java Code Execution Error

## Problem Solved
Your error `"can't find main(String[]) method in class: Solution"` is now **FIXED**!

## What Was The Issue?
1. **Judge0 API** required payment (Indian cards not accepted)
2. **Java code** needed a `main` method but users were writing just Solution classes

## Solutions Implemented

### 1️⃣ FREE API (No Payment)
✅ Switched from Judge0 to **Piston API**  
✅ **100% FREE** - No credit card needed  
✅ Works perfectly in India  

### 2️⃣ Auto-Wrapping Java Code
✅ Automatically adds `main` method to Java code  
✅ Users can write just Solution classes  
✅ No more "can't find main" errors  

## 🚀 Start Using NOW

```bash
# Start your Django server
python manage.py runserver
```

That's it! Everything works now!

## ✨ What Users Can Do Now

### Write Java Code ANY Way They Want:

**Option 1: Just statements** (We add main for them)
```java
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```

**Option 2: Solution class** (We add main for them)
```java
class Solution {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

**Option 3: Complete code** (We leave it as-is)
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello!");
    }
}
```

**ALL THREE WORK!** ✅

## 🧪 Test It Yourself

```bash
# Run the test suite
python test_java_wrapper.py
```

You should see:
```
✅ All tests passing!
✅ Java code auto-wrapping is working!
```

## 📊 What Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.env` | Using Piston API (free) |
| `problems/services.py` | Added auto-wrapping for Java code |
